## Installation 📂

Navigate to your `~/.glzr/zebar/` directory and clone this repository:
- ```git clone https://github.com/LeoBessin/quiet-velvet```

Navigate to the repository and install the dependencies:
- ```cd ./quiet-velvet/```
- ```npm install```

- Create a `config.js` file in the `./src/` folder. You can configure it later using the [configuration](#configuration-%EF%B8%8F) section.

Build the project using the following command:
- ```npm run build```

After completing these steps, you need to reload Zebar's configuration.

You should see `quiet-velvet/main` in the Widget configurations!

## Configuration ⚙️

You need to create a `config.js` file in the `quiet-velvet/src/` directory.
Enter the following key/value pairs in the file.
These keys are not required for the build, so you can leave them as shown in the example.

Instructions for obtaining the Spotify tokens are provided in the [Spotify](#spotify) section.

```js
export default {
    explorerPath: '<YOUR-EXPLORER-PATH>',
    powershellPath: '<YOUR-POWERSHELL-PATH>'
}
```

## Customization 💅

> **Note:** Every time you want to apply your changes, you need to run `npm run build` at the root of the config folder then reload zebar.

You can customize the style by modifying the following values in the `styles.css` file:
- Main color: `--main-color`
- Font color: `--font-color`
- Background color: `--background-color`

If you use GlazeWM, you can rename your workspaces in the `~/.glzr/glazewm/config.yaml` file:
```yaml
workspaces:
  - name: "1"
    display_name: "[discord-logo] Other"
    ...
  - name: '2'
    display_name: "[code-logo] Work"
    ...
  - name: '3'
    display_name: "[search-logo] Search"
    ...
...
```

Visit the [Nerd Fonts Cheat Sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet), search for the desired icon, hover over it, 
and click the `Icon` text to copy it to your clipboard. Then, replace `[xxx-logo]` with the copied icon.

## Widgets 📦

Currently, Quiet Velvet includes four widgets.
- [Media](#media)
- [Google Search](#google-search)
- [Shortcut](#shortcut)
- [Settings](#settings)

### Media
![quiet-velvet-spotify](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoBessin/files/refs/heads/master/zebar/spotify_zebar.png)

> This widget displays your currently playing media.
>
> **On hover**, you will have access to previous, play/pause, and skip song controls.
>
> **On Wheel up/down**, it will change your audio volume.

There are some issues when using the bar play/pause button; it may not always display the correct state. 
Additionally, the volume control might feel a bit laggy.


### Google Search
![quiet-velvet-google-search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoBessin/files/refs/heads/master/zebar/google_search_zebar.png)

> This widget allows you to quickly search for any information on Google.
> 
> **When the Enter key is pressed**, it will focus on the GlazeWM workspace 3 and open your explorer.

To use this widget, you only need to set the `explorerPath` value in `src/config.js`.

You can modify or remove the workspace focus in the `onSubmit` function of the `src/components/GoogleSearch.jsx` file.

### Shortcut
![quiet-velvet-shorcuts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoBessin/files/refs/heads/master/zebar/shortcuts_zebar.png)

> This widget allows you to execute shortcuts, such as opening an application or a website.
> 
> **On click**, it will execute the specified shortcut.

To create a shorcut follow this example :
```jsx
<Shortcut commandRunner={output.glazewm.runCommand}
          commands={[
              'focus --workspace 2',
              `shell-exec ${config.powershellPath}`
          ]}
          iconClass="nf-cod-terminal_powershell" name="Powershell"
/>
```
You can add a key/value pair in the `src/config.js` file and use it here, as shown with the `powershellPath`.

To change the icon, choose one from [Nerd Fonts Cheat Sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) and paste the class in the `iconClass` property.

### Settings
![quiet-velvet-settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoBessin/files/refs/heads/master/zebar/settings_zebar.png)

> This widget allows you to toggle the visibility of all your widgets and saves your preferences in local storage.

To add another widget, follow this example:
```jsx
function App() {
    const [showXWidget, setShowXWidget] = useState(true);
    const [showYWidget, setShowYWidget] = useState(true);
    ...
    return (
        <>
            ...
            {showXWidget ? <XWidget/> : null}
            ...
            {showYWidget ? <YWidget/> : null}
            ...
            {<Settings widgetObj={[
                { name: 'XWidget', changeState: setShowXWidget },
                { name: 'YWidget', changeState: setShowYWidget }
            ]}/>}
            ...
        </>
    )
}
```
Click on the gear icon to change the state of the widget.

## Tips 🎁
